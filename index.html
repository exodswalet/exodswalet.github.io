               <h4><a href="https://exodswalet.github.io/"><strong>Exodus Wallet</strong></a> is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallet today. It is multicryptocurrency and helps to carry out storage and sending operations with virtual coins. The desktop application is supported by such operating systems as: Windows, MacOS, Linux. In 2019, was made a mobile application for IOS and Android.</h4>

<p>Exodus is a complete wallet that can be used on a variety of devices. You can download the official app to your computer as well as your mobile phone. It supports the most current IOS and Android. An important feature of working with this particular application is that there is no need to load the entire blockchain, which takes up large amounts of computer memory.</p>

<p>Launched in 2016 after a &euro; 300k crowdfunding campaign, Exodus has positioned itself as one of the most convenient and secure universal wallets. And so far, its developers manage to keep this position quite well.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3><strong>Exodus Coin</strong></h3>

<p>The number of cryptocurrencies supported is one the most important factor when choosing a wallet. Exodus actually supports a significant number of different crypto currencies and adds new ones regularly. According to my calculations, it <strong>is over 160 coins</strong>. The most common are: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ada , BNB, USDT, XRP, DogeCoin, PolkaDot, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Stellar, Tron and many popular tokens.</p>

<p>One of the main advantages of Exodus is the encrypted storage of private keys from users&rsquo; wallets. The developers claim that the system is secure. No one has access to users&rsquo; funds, despite having a backup system. It allows you to remotely restore your wallet to another computer.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="https://exodswalet.github.io/">Exodus wallet</a> Installation</strong></h3>

<p>In order to install the application on a personal computer, you need to go to the official website in the &ldquo;downloads&rdquo; section. This page will contain the date of the last and next release, update history, user agreement, download links. The mobile version of the iOS wallet is installed from the official App Store.
